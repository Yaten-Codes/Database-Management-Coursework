# **README: Database Management Coursework (CS 390) - Skills & Learnings**  

This repository contains SQL files developed as part of my **Database Management coursework (CS 390)**. Through these exercises, I gained hands-on experience with **database design, querying, optimization, and administration** using **Structured Query Language (SQL)**. Below is a summary of the key concepts and skills I practiced.  

---

## **ðŸ“Œ Key Skills & Learnings**  

### **1. Database Design & Schema Definition**  
- Created and modified database schemas using **Data Definition Language (DDL)**  
- Defined **tables, constraints (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, CHECK), and indexes**  
- Practiced **normalization (1NF, 2NF, 3NF, BCNF)** to eliminate redundancy  
- Designed **Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams** and translated them into SQL schemas  

### **2. SQL Querying & Data Manipulation**  
- Wrote **complex SELECT queries** with:  
  - **JOINs (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL, CROSS)**  
  - **Subqueries & Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**  
  - **Aggregate functions (GROUP BY, HAVING, COUNT, SUM, AVG, etc.)**  
  - **Sorting & filtering (ORDER BY, WHERE, LIKE, IN, BETWEEN, etc.)**  
- Performed **CRUD operations (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, MERGE)**  
- Used **set operations (UNION, INTERSECT, EXCEPT)**  

### **3. Advanced SQL Features**  
- Created and utilized **views** for simplified data access  
- Developed **stored procedures & functions** for reusable logic  
- Implemented **triggers** for automated database actions  
- Used **transactions (BEGIN, COMMIT, ROLLBACK)** for data integrity  

### **4. Database Administration & Optimization**  
- Managed **user permissions (GRANT, REVOKE, ROLES)**  
- Optimized queries using **indexes & execution plans**  
- Practiced **backup & recovery techniques**  
- Analyzed query performance and applied tuning strategies

## **ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure**  
The SQL files in this repository cover:  
- **Basic SQL commands** (DDL, DML, DQL)  
- **Database design projects** (ER modeling, normalization)  
- **Complex query challenges** (multi-table joins, subqueries, aggregations)  
- **Real-world scenarios** (sample databases for HR, inventory, sales, etc.)  

---

## **ðŸ›  Tools & Technologies Used**  
- **SQL** (Standard SQL, with some DBMS-specific syntax)  
- **Database Management Systems (DBMS):**  
  - MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQLite (or other RDBMS used)  
- **Optional:** ER diagram tools (e.g., Lucidchart, draw.io)

## **ðŸŽ¯ Takeaways & Real-World Applications**  
By completing these SQL exercises, I strengthened my ability to:  
âœ” Design efficient and normalized database schemas  
âœ” Write optimized queries for data retrieval and manipulation  
âœ” Implement security and integrity constraints  
âœ” Troubleshoot performance issues in SQL  
âœ” Apply database concepts in real-world applications (web backends, data analysis, reporting)  

This coursework provided a solid foundation for working with relational databases in **software development, data engineering, and database administration roles**.

### **ðŸ”— How to Use This Repository**  
1. Clone the repo and explore the SQL files.  
2. Run them in a SQL-compatible DBMS (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.).  
3. Modify and experiment with queries to deepen understanding.  

**ðŸš€ Ready to apply these skills in real-world database projects!**
